# AUTHOR COMMENT: MIMI is a program developed as part of my PhD and was supported
# by MQ RTP Scholarship.

# PURPOSE:For use in comparing the chemical extracts of microbial cocultures to 
# their axenic monocultures.

# INPUT: Interaction_Matrix - A df containing the columns CON1, CON2	& Coculture
# is required to be made and imported by the user to compare samples.

# OUTPUT: An output file (.csv) is created matching the peaks from the coculture
# to peaks in either of the two controls, quantifying the change in peak area.
# Further manipulation is needed in Script_2 to remove doubley assigned peaks,
# identify non UVs and add in peaks belonging to the control(s).

# R packages required to be loaded in:

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readxl)

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Functions to be pre-loaded prior to use of the main function, MIMI()

# 1.ReadExcel - Reads in the NovaC files corresponding to a particular row number 
# in the Interaction_Matrix. See MIMI_Code_Book for explanation of NovaC.

# 2.CheckUVCount - Compares the top 5 UV maxima of a matched peak in the control 
# of interest and the coculture.

# 3.ReadUV - Reads in the UV spectral data (abs vs. wavelength) for the 
# corresponding 3 samples being compared.

# 4.SubtractUV - Subtracts the UV spectrum of the control of interest from the 
# coculture, and takes the mean(Abs).

# 5.RowBinder - Binds the matched peak found in PeakMatcher to a df named cc.df

# 6.CalcRatio: Calculates the %Enhancement/Suppresion compared to control levels

# 7.PeakMatcher - PeakMatcher: Matches and verifies peaks from the control of 
# interest to peaks in the coculture, utilising a combination of retention time, 
# number of matching UV maxima (UVcheck) and the means of the subtracted UV 
# spectra (UVsubtract).

# 8.ConConsolidator - Consolidates the outcome table to match peaks from coculture 
# to a single peak in a control. Compares subtracted UV spectra to make decisions 
# based on double matching.

# 9.EffectCategoriser - Characterises the Peak Area ratio as an effect to the 
# metabolite in the coculture (induction, suppression, etc.).

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Special Terms:
# 1. CC - coculture: the duoculture of two organisms grown together.
# 2. con - control: the axenic monoculture of one of the organisms.
