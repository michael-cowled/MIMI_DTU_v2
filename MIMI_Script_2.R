# COPYWRIGHT: Â© Macquarie University - Michael Cowled and contributors [2021]

# INPUT: The output file from Script_1 is used as the input file for Script_2.

# OUTPUT: A refined output file (.csv) is generated that remove doubley assigned 
# peaks, identifies non UVs and adds in peaks belonging to the control(s).


# The same R packages required of MIMI_Script_1 are required here.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Functions to be pre-loaded prior to use of the main function, MIMI2()

# 1.SimpleEffectCategoriser - Uses the principles of the EffectCategoriser 
# function to categorise based on a single PeakRatio input.

# 2.DoublePeakChecker: Finds and reports instances of double peak matching

# 3.IdentifyBadPeak: Decides on which of the doubley assigned peaks to remove

# 4.RemoveDoubleyAssignedPeaks -Checks for a peak in the control being assigned 
# to more than one peak in the coculture. Uses the number of matching UV maxima 
# and/or the subtracted UV spectra to make decisions as to which peak is a better 
# match.

# 5.PeakAssigner: Adds the assignment of the matched non UV peak from MatchNonUVs

# 6.MatchNonUVs - - Tentatively assigns matched peaks as non UVs 
# (or as distorted UVs) if matching the conditions.

# 7.RowBinder2: A variant of RowBinder used for adding missing control peaks

# 8.FindMissingcontrolPeaks - Adds in unassigned peaks from the controls to 
# provide a single, unified table.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Note: Some functions as part of this script rely on functions from MIMI_Script_1.

# Reading in the functions:
